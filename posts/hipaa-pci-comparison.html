<h2>HIPAA vs. PCI DSS â€” Whatâ€™s the Difference?</h2>
<p>Both are compliance standards, but they serve different sectors:</p>

<h3>HIPAA (Healthcare)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Protects patient health data</li>
  <li>Applies to hospitals, insurers, clinics</li>
  <li>Requires strict access controls and audit logs</li>
</ul>

<h3>PCI DSS (Finance)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Protects cardholder data</li>
  <li>Applies to merchants and payment processors</li>
  <li>Focuses on secure encryption and network security</li>
</ul>

<p>ðŸ”’ <em>In the cloud, both require robust encryption and access policies â€” but the specifics differ by sector.</em></p>
